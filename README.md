This thesis addresses the star-rating classification task on a text review dataset, while handling the challenges of class imbalance and semantic ambiguity. This thesis involves multiple machine learning models and two pre-trained language models (BERT & DeBERTa). To address imbalance learning, experiments mainly focus on the adjustment of loss function while considering thorough classification metrics. To tackle semantic ambiguity, experiments employ label distribution learning and introduce appropriate metrics to evaluate.
